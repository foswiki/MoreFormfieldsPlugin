---++ Description

This plugin implements a set of additional special purpose formfields to be used in [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm]] definitions.

To make use of these formfields use their type identifier in the "Type" column of a !DataForm definition, such as in

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| Attachment | attachment | 20 | | | | 
| Bytes | bytes | 10 | | | |
| Date2 | date2 | 30  | | | |
| Datetime | datetime | 30  | | | |
| Group | group | 20 | | | |
| Icon | icon | 20 | | | | 
| Ipaddress | ipaddress | 15  | |  |  |
| Ipv6address | ipv6address | 40  | |  |  |
| Macaddress | macaddress | 17  | | | |
| Masked | masked | 17 | | | |
| Natedit | natedit | 80x25 | | | |
| Multitext | multitext | 80 | | | |
| Netmask | netmask | 15  | | |  |
| Phonenumber | phonenumber | 20 | | | | 
| Random | random | 20 | | | | 
| Select2 | select2 | 20 | | | |
| Slider | slider | 20 | | | |
| Smartbox | smartbox | 5 |  | | |
| Time | time | 20 | | | |
| Toggle | toggle | 2 | | | |
| Topic | topic | 30 | | | |
| User Or Group | userorgroup | 30 | | | |
| User | user | 30 | | | |
| Uuid | uuid | 30 | | | |
| Web | web | 30 | | | |

When defining a formfield additional parameters may be used in the "Values" column to further customize the behavior of the element.

---++ Known Formfield types

---+++ attachment 

This formfield stores a reference to an attachment. Attachments of the current topic are selectable or any other topic attached to as 
specified in the =topic= parameter. The formfield lets you upload new attachments right from within the edit dialog.

*Parameters*:

   * =web=, =topic=: location where attachments are searched for, defaults to current web.topic
   * =url=: url for autocompletion, defaults to an internal template =select2::attachment::url=
   * =filter=: regular expression of files allowed to be uploaded
   * =sortable=: entries in an =attachment+multi= formfield can be reordered using drag'n'drop if set to =true=
   * =upload=: boolean switch to enable/disable uploading an attachment, defaults to =off=

---+++ autofill

A formfield that is filled automatically based on values from one or more other formfields of the same topic. During an edit-save loop, values of fields listed in the =source= parameter
are extracted and concatenated using the specified =separator=. Values of an =autofill= formfield cannot be edited by the user.

*Parameters*:

Either use this approach:

   * =format=: specify a format string to build up the autofill formfield; use =$&lt;field-name>= to reference a formfield (see example below)

... or do it the old way by looping over formfields:

   * =header=: add an optional string prefixed to the field value, but only when the source fields are not empty
   * =fields=: comma-separated list of one or more formfields to fetch values from
   * =separator=: separator used when concatenating all values into a new value for the =autofill= field
   * =footer=: append an optional string to the field value, but only when the source fields are not empty

A typical use-case for an =autofill= field is the construction of a !TopicTitle based on other form properties:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| <nop>TopicTitle1 | autofill |  1  | header="Project" fields="Customer, ID, Year" |  |  |
| <nop>TopicTitle2 | autofill |  1  | format="Project-$ID ($Customer, $Year)" |  |  |
| Customer | text | 80 | | | |
| ID | id | 4 | | | |
| Year | text | 4 | | | |

An =autofill= formfield is either displayed as created by the formating rules. Or the resulting value may be displayed otherwise using
a =display="..."= wiki app. Another more comfortable way is to cast the value into a different formfield type using the =type="..."= parameter.
That way the computed value may be displayed using the formfield definition of the given type. The following example will query the date of the most
recent comment and store it as epoch seconds in a "Last Reply" formfield. It is then displayed using the =Datetime= definition instead of displaying
the epoch seconds as is:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| Last Reply | autofill | 1 | type="datetime" format="$percntFORMATLIST{\"$percntQUERY{\"'$percntBASEWEB$percnt.$percntBASETOPIC$percnt'/META:COMMENT.date\"}$percnt\" sort=\"on\" reverse=\"on\" limit=\"1\"}$percnt" | date of latest reply | | |


---+++ autoinc 

This is a formfield type that extens Foswiki's core AUTOINC mechanism to enumerate topics when they are created and brings it to 
formfields. A unique number is assigned to =autoinc= formfields whenever a topic is created will having such a !DataForm attached to it.
Provisions are taken that these numbers are unique among each other. This feature allow to define number ranges based on the given configuration.

A typical use case would be to have different number ranges based on another formfield, say !ProjectType:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| <nop>Type | radio | 3 | new product, experimental, enhancement | specifies the kind of project that is carried out | M |
| <nop>Number | autoinc | 5 | start="1000" query="Type='$Type'" | unique project number | h |

Whenever a topic with such a !DataForm definition is used will the Number property be calculated given the =start= and =query= parameters.
That is, a unique number will be assigned for each type of project "new product", "experimental" and "enhancement". All "new product" projects
receive unique numbers among each other, likewise all "experimental" projects and "enhancement" projects. 

Numbering starts at the value given to the =start= parameter, 1000 in above example. The size column of an =autoinc= formfield specifies the number of digits the number 
should have similar to the =id= formfield. By default numbering starts at zero. 

By default, number ranges are specified among topics using the same !DataForm by means of a "base query" that filters for topics of the same kind.
This list is then subdivided by the given =query=. If for some reason you'd like to implement number ranges among different !DataForms you can
disable this base query using the parameter =basequery="off"=. Not however that you should definitely define a more elaborate query to prevent
unexpected numbering among other content in the same web (see [[%SYSTEMWEB%.QuerySearch]].)

---+++ bytes

This formfield displays a numeric value in a "humanized" bytes notation, using magnitutes of two:
B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB and ZB. 

Example:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| File Size | bytes | 10 | max="MB" prec="4" | | |

The "FileSize" formfield will display the value using a maximum magnitude of megabytes using a precision of 4.

For instance a value of =2033189908= will be displayed as 1939.0010 MB given the parameters in above example definition. 
Without any parameters this value value would be displayed using the simples way, 1.89 GB in this case.

---+++ date2

This is an alternative for the core =date= formfield type using the jQuery-ui datepicker widget instead of using the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.JSCalendarContrib][Mishoo JSCalendar widget]].
It will launch a calendar when clicking into a =date2= formfield to select a date from, as well as restricts allowed keys to be entered into the formfield. The format of a =date2= formfield value
will always be of a =YYYY-MM-DD= pattern and thus not be depending on any locale settings. This is quite important to get consistant data rather than differences based on the user's current browser language.
While the _value_ stored into a =date2= formfield is locale-independent will it display according to the settings of =$Foswiki::cfg{DefaultDateFormat}= settings.

Example:

| Date | date2 | 40 | mindate="-7d" maxdate="+7d" weekends="off" | | |

---+++ datetime

This formfield type combines a =date2= formfield with a =time= formfield thus letting you pick a date time with a minute precision.

Example:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| Datetime | datetime | 10 | lang="en" timezone="gmtime" | | |

*Parameters*:

   * =lang=: language of the input element, defaults to the current user's interface language
   * =format=: display format of the field, default to =$Foswiki::cfg{DateManipPlugin}{DefaultDateTimeFormat}= or =%d %b %Y - %H:%M=
   * =tz=, =timezone=: timezone defaults to the one definied in =LocalSite.cfg= that is gmtime or servertime

---+++ group

A group reference using !JQSelect2Contrib for autocompletion.

*Parameters*:

   * =url=: url for autocompletion, default: =%<nop>SCRIPTURL{"rest"}%/MoreFormfieldsPlugin/users=
   * =include=: regular expression a group must match to be included in the selection
   * =exclude=: regular expression a group must not match to be included
   * =sortable=: entries in an =group+multi= formfield can be reordered using drag'n'drop if set to =true=

---+++ icon

A select box to chose an icon supported by Foswiki (famfamfam and fontawesome).

*Parameters*:

   * =cat=: list of icon categories to be included in the selection
   * =include=: regular expression of icons to include in the selection
   * =exclude=: regular expression of icons to be excluded from the selection

An icon category can be either a topic on the icon search path as defined in =$Foswiki::cfg{JQueryPlugin}{IconSearchPath}=:

   * =famfamfam= ... to select famfamfam icons only
   * =silkicons= ... to selec from a silk icon only,
   * =flagicons= ... to select a flag
   * ...

Or an icon category as defined in the fontawesome definition:

   * Brand Icons
   * Chart Icons
   * Currency Icons
   * Directional Icons
   * File Type Icons
   * Form Control Icons
   * Medical Icons
   * Payment Icons
   * Spinner Icons
   * Text Editor Icons
   * Video Player Icons
   * Web Application Icons

Examples:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* | *Default* |
| <nop>FamFamFamIcon | icon | 20 | cat="famfamfam" | | | |
| <nop>SilkIcon | icon | 20 | cat="silkicon" | | | |
| <nop>MintIcon | icon | 20 | cat="minticons" | | | |
| <nop>FlagIcon | icon | 20 | cat="flagicons" | | | |
| <nop>WebApp | icon | 20 | cat="Web App" | | | |

---+++ id

Extract the numeric identifier from the topic (or web) name. This is most usefull for topics created using the =AUTOINC= feature (see [[TemplateTopics]]).
The =AUTOINC= feature adds a numeric unique identifier when the topic is created. This identifier can be extracted  using an =id= formfield type 
and stored into a !DataForm and be available for formatted searches.

The value in the "Size" column will be used to add leading zeros to the id. For example, given a topic !FooBar1 has a !DataForm

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| ID | id | 4 | from="topic" | | |

Then upon save the =id= formfield will have a value of =0001=. There is an optional "from" parameter that may have values "topic" (default) or "web".
It defines the source from which to derive the value of the =id= formfield.

*Parameters*: none

---+++ ipaddress

A general purpose IPv4 address, consisting of 4 octets, e.g. =10.0.0.1= 

*Parameters*: none

---+++ ipv6address

A general purpose IPv6 address,e.g. =2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348=

*Parameters*: none

---+++ macaddress

A hardware address given in 6 hex values, e.g. =00:1a:10:6f:ba:12=

*Parameters*: none

---+++ masked

A normal textfield with optional masked input using [[JQIMaskContrib]]

*Parameters*:

   * =mask=: input mask 
   * =placeholder=: placeholder character, defaults to underscore

---+++ multitext

This is a kind of =text+multi= formfield. it stores multiple text formfields in one. 

*Parameters*: 

   * =sortable=: set this to =true= to be able to reorder entries using drag'n'drop
   * =separator=: separator between individual text entries, defaults to =,=. NOTE that you need to choose a separator string appropriate for the expected input.
     for instance, by default entries are separated by comma (=,=), so any string holding a comma will be separated in multiple text entries during edit. a good 
     alternative is =\n= to separate strings by newline, which should be fine for a list of multiple one-line text entries.

---+++ natedit

This renders a textarea using the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.NatEditPlugin][NatEditPlugin]]. The size of the imput fields is specified similar to the standard =textarea=
formfield type. 

*Parameters*: 

  * =showToolbar=: boolean ("true" or "false") to show/hide the edit toolbar, default "true"
  * =autoResize=: boolean switch to automatically adjust the height of the editor to fit its content, default "false"
  * =resizable=: boolean to enable/disable manual resizability of the edit area, default "false"
  * =autoHideToolbar=: boolean to enable/disable the toolbar to be displayed when the editor is focused and hidden when leaving the editor, default "false"
  * =autoMaxExpand=: boolean to automatically expand the editor to a maximum height, default "false"
  * =minHeight=: minimum height of the editor
  * =maxHeight=: maximum height of the editor

---+++ netmask

A special IP address used for routing, consisting of 4 octets, e.g. =255.255.255.0=

---+++ phonenumber

A standard telephone number. This formfield uses <nop>JQueryValidate to make sure the formfield value is a valid phone number.

*Parameters*: none

---+++ random

This formfield type generates a random value the first time the topic is created. There are a set of different random strings:

   * alpha
   * upperalpha
   * loweralpha
   * numeric
   * alphanumeric
   * misc
   * all (alpha, numeric, misc)

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| Random | random | 10 | charset="alphanumeric" min="1" max="10" | | |

This will generate a random number of 10 characters of the given charset. If the parameters =min= and =max= are definied will the
size of the value vary between the given limits.

---+++ select2

A drop-in replacement for the standard =select= formfield. See [[JQSelect2Contrib]].

*Parameters:* none

---+++ slider

   * =format=: format to display the range value(s); this can be any specification understood by sprintf, defaults to "%s" for single values and "%s - %s" for range values

Examples:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* | *Default* |
| Simple Slider | slider | 20 |  | | | |
| Formated Slider | slider | 20 | format="%3d%%" | | | 20 |

| Priority | slider | 20 | none, low, medium, high, urgend, emergency | | | none |
| Priority Range | slider | 20 | values="none, low, medium, high, urgend, emergency" range="on" | | | medium, high |
| Percent | slider | 20 | max="1" step="0.01" format="%.2f" | | | |

---+++ smartbox

A somewhat "smarter" checkbox formfield type. It allows to select one of the values as a placeholder representing "any" value in the selection.

So given these !DataForm definitions ...

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* | *Default* |
| Business Area | smartbox | 5 | Energy, Maritime, Oil & Gas, Software, All Business Areas* | | | |

Selecting "All Business Areas" or "Europe" will select/unselect all entries at once. 
The "any value" selection is the one indicated by the "*" asterisk, or if not present the first in the list.

---+++ time

A time formfield using the clockpicker widget from http://weareoutman.github.io/clockpicker/

Example:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |

---+++ toggle

A toggle formfield may switch between two values, by default between "on" and "off". Alternative values may be specified like this:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* | *Default* |
| *Toggle*  | toggle | 1 | done | |  | |
| *Toggle*  | toggle | 2 | on, off | |  | off |
| *Toggle*  | toggle+values | 2 | enabled=1, disabled=0 | |  | disabled |

Note that the size column has no effect.

---+++ topic

A topic reference using !JQSelect2Contrib for autocompletion.

*Parameters*:

   * =web=: the web the user can choose topics from; defaults to current web
   * =default=: the default value to use if no value exists yet

   * =exclude=: regular expression topics must not match to be included
   * =format=: format string how to render a topic value while editing, defaults to =$topictitle=
   * =sortable=: entries in an =topic+multi= formfield can be reordered using drag'n'drop if set to =true=

Custom parameters may be added. These will be appended to the autocompletion url.

There are a couple of parameters that further customize the behavior of the select2 widget. Some of the most useful ones are:

   * =minimumInputLength=: number of characters that have to be entered before the autocompletion url is called to fetch matching selections from the backend; default 0
   * =quietMillis=: number of milliseconds to wait for input before the backend is called for autocompletion
   * =limit=: maximum number of values fetched from the autocompletion backend, default 10

These are also available for the =user= and =icon= formfield types.

---+++ userorgroup

This formfield type combines =user= and =group= formfields providing the same parameters.

---+++ user

A user reference using !JQSelect2Contrib for autocompletion.

*Parameters*:

   * =url=: url for autocompletion, default: =%<nop>SCRIPTURL{"rest"}%/MoreFormfieldsPlugin/users=
   * =group=: members of one or more groups to select from
   * =include=: regular expression a user must match to be included in the selection
   * =exclude=: regular expression a user must not match to be included
   * =sortable=: entries in an =user+multi= formfield can be reordered using drag'n'drop if set to =true=

---+++ uuid

This formfield type generates a random UUID code the first time the topic is created.

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| Uuid | uuid | 30 | prefix="foobar" charset="upperalpha" | | |

The charset might be: =upperalpha= (default) or =loweralpha=

UUIDs have got the format =XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX= where the X chars are upper or lowercase hex values as specified by 
the =charset= parameter.
An optional =prefix= parameter might be specified in which case the code will be =&lt;prefix>-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX=.

---+++ web

This formfield stores a reference to  web.

*Parameters*:

   * =webs=: a list of webs to be displayed, "public", "user, "template", defaults to "user" to select any web except System, Trash, Applications and all template webs 
   * =include=: regular expression webs must match to be included in the selection
   * =exclude=: regular expression webs must match to be excluded; =exclude= has got higher precedence than the =webs= parameter if specified.
   * =url=: url for autocompletion, defaults to an internal template =select2::wweb::url=
