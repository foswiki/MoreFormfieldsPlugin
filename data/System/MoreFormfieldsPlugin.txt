---++ Description

This plugin implements a set of additional special purpose formfields to be used in [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DataForms][DataForm]] definitions.

To make use of these formfields use their type identifier in the =Type= column of a !DataForm definition, such as in

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| Attachment | attachment | 20 | | | | 
| Bytes | bytes | 10 | | | |
| Date2 | date2 | 30  | | | |
| Icon | icon | 20 | | | | 
| Ipaddress | ipaddress | 15  | | network address |  |
| Ipv6address | ipv6address | 40  | | network address |  |
| Macaddress | macaddress | 17  | | hardware-addresse | |
| Netmask | netmask | 15  | | netmask |  |
| Phonenumber | phonenumber | 20 | | | | 
| Select2 | select2 | 20 | | | |
| Time | time | 20 | | | |
| Topic | topic | 20 | | | |
| User | user | 20 | | | |

When defining a formfield additional parameters may be used in the =Values= column to further customize the behavior of the element.

---++ Known Formfield types

---+++ =autoinc= 

This is a formfield type that extens Foswiki's core AUTOINC mechanism to enumerate topics when they are created and brings it to 
formfields. A unique number is assigned to =autoinc= formfields whenever a topic is created will having such a !DataForm attached to it.
Provisions are taken that these numbers are unique among each other. This feature allow to define number ranges based on the given configuration.

A typical use case would be to have different number ranges based on another formfield, say !ProjectType:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| <nop>Type | radio | 3 | new product, experimental, enhancement | specifies the kind of project that is carried out | M |
| <nop>Number | autoinc | 5 | start="1000" query="Type='$Type'" | unique project number | h |

Whenever a topic with such a !DataForm definition is used will the Number property be calculated given the =start= and =query= parameters.
That is, a unique number will be assigned for each type of project "new product", "experimental" and "enhancement". All "new product" projects
receive unique numbers among each other, likewise all "experimental" projects and "enhancement" projects. 

Numbering starts at the value given to the =start= parameter, 1000 in above example. The size column of an =autoinc= formfield specifies the number of digits the number 
should have similar to the =id= formfield. By default numbering starts at zero. 

By default, number ranges are specified among topics using the same !DataForm by means of a "base query" that filters for topics of the same kind.
This list is then subdivided by the given =query=. If for some reason you'd like to implement number ranges among different !DataForms you can
disable this base query using the parameter =basequery="off"=. Not however that you should definitely define a more elaborate query to prevent
unexpected numbering among other content in the same web (see [[%SYSTEMWEB%.QuerySearch]].)


---+++ =autofill=

A formfield that is filled automatically based on values from one or more other formfields of the same topic. During an edit-save loop, values of fields listed in the =source= parameter
are extracted and concatenated using the specified =separator=. Values of an =autofill= formfield cannot be edited by the user.

*Parameters*:

Either use this approach:

   * =format=: specify a format string to build up the autofill formfield; use =$&lt;field-name>= to reference a formfield (see example below)

... or do it the old way by looping over formfields:

   * =header=: add an optional string prefixed to the field value, but only when the source fields are not empty
   * =fields=: comma-separated list of one or more formfields to fetch values from
   * =separator=: separator used when concatenating all values into a new value for the =autofill= field
   * =footer=: append an optional string to the field value, but only when the source fields are not empty

A typical use-case for an =autofill= field is the construction of a !TopicTitle based on other form properties:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| <nop>TopicTitle1 | autofill |  1  | header="Project" fields="Customer, ID, Year" |  |  |
| <nop>TopicTitle2 | autofill |  1  | format="Project-$ID ($Customer, $Year)" |  |  |
| Customer | text | 80 | | | |
| ID | id | 4 | | | |
| Year | text | 4 | | | |

---+++ =bytes=

This formfield displays a numeric value in a "humanized" bytes notation, using magnitutes of two:
B, KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB and ZB. 

Example:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| File Size | bytes | 10 | max="MB" prec="4" | | |

The =FileSize= formfield will display the value using a maximum magnitude of megabytes using a precision of 4.

For instance a value of =2033189908= will be displayed as 1939.0010 MB given the parameters in above example definition. 
Without any parameters this value value would be displayed using the simples way, 1.89 GB in this case.


---+++ =date2=

This is an alternative for the core =date= formfield type using the [[JQueryUI][jQuery-ui datepicker widget]] instead of using the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.JSCalendarContrib][Mishoo JSCalendar widget]].
It will launch a calendar when clicking into a =date2= formfield to select a date from, as well as restricts allowed keys to be entered into the formfield. The format of a =date2= formfield value
will always be of a =YYYY-MM-DD= pattern and thus not be depending on any locale settings. This is quite important to get consistant data rather than differences based on the user's current browser language.
While the _value_ stored into a =date2= formfield is locale-independent will it display according to the settings of =$Foswiki::cfg{DefaultDateFormat}= settings.

---+++ =icon=

A select box to chose an icon supported by Foswiki (famfamfam and fontawesome).

*Parameters*:

   * =cat=: list of icon categories to be included in the selection
   * =include=: regular expression of icons to include in the selection
   * =exclude=: regular expression of icons to be excluded from the selection

An icon category can be either a topic on the icon search path as defined in =$Foswiki::cfg{JQueryPlugin}{IconSearchPath}=:

   * =famfamfam= ... to select famfamfam icons only
   * =silkicons= ... to selec from a silk icon only,
   * =flagicons= ... to select a flag
   * ...

Or an icon category as defined in the fontawesome definition:

   * Brand Icons
   * Chart Icons
   * Currency Icons
   * Directional Icons
   * File Type Icons
   * Form Control Icons
   * Medical Icons
   * Payment Icons
   * Spinner Icons
   * Text Editor Icons
   * Video Player Icons
   * Web Application Icons

Examples:

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* | *Default* |
| <nop>FamFamFamIcon | icon | 20 | cat="famfamfam" | | | |
| <nop>SilkIcon | icon | 20 | cat="silkicon" | | | |
| <nop>MintIcon | icon | 20 | cat="minticons" | | | |
| <nop>FlagIcon | icon | 20 | cat="flagicons" | | | |
| <nop>WebApp | icon | 20 | cat="Web App" | | | |

---+++ =id=

Extract the numeric identifier from the topic name. This is most usefull for topics created using the =AUTOINC= feature (see [[TemplateTopics]]).
The =AUTOINC= feature adds a numeric unique identifier when the topic is created. This identifier can be extracted  using an =id= formfield type 
and stored into a !DataForm and be available for formatted searches.

The value in the =Size= column will be used to add leading zeros to the id. For example, given a topic !FooBar1 has a !DataForm

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* |
| ID | id | 4 | | | |

Then upon save the =id= formfield will have a value of =0001=.

*Parameters*: none

---+++ =ipaddress=

A general purpose IPv4 address, consisting of 4 octets, e.g. =10.0.0.1= 

*Parameters*: none

---+++ =ipv6address=

A general purpose IPv6 address,e.g. =2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348=

*Parameters*: none

---+++ =macaddress=

A hardware address given in 6 hex values, e.g. =00:1a:10:6f:ba:12=

*Parameters*: none

---+++ =natedit=

This renders a textarea using the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.NatEditPlugin][NatEditPlugin]]. The size of the imput fields is specified similar to the standard =textarea=
formfield type. Any additional parameters specific to =natedit= may be specified in the "Values" column.

---+++ =netmask=

A special IP address used for routing, consisting of 4 octets, e.g. =255.255.255.0=

---+++ =phonenumber=

A standard telephone number. This formfield uses [[JQueryValidate]] to make sure the formfield value is a valid phone number.

*Parameters*: none

---+++ =select2=

A drop-in replacement for the standard =select= formfield. See [[JQSelect2Contrib]].

*Parameters:* none

---+++ =smartbox=

A somewhat "smarter" checkbox formfield type. It allows to select one of the values as a placeholder representing "any" value in the selection.

So given this !DataForm definition ...

| *Name*  | *Type* | *Size* | *Values* | *Description* | *Attributes* | *Default* |
| Business Area | smartbox | 5 | Energy, Maritime, Oil & Gas, Software, Across all Business Areas* | | | |

... then selecting "Accross all Business Areas" will select all other areas with it. Likewise, selecting all 
business areas indivudually will automatically select "Accross all Business Areas" as well.

Note that the "any value" selection is the one indicated by the "*" asterisk, or if not present the first in the list.

---+++ =time=

A time formfield using the clockpicker widget from http://weareoutman.github.io/clockpicker/

---+++ =topic=

A topic reference using JQSelect2Contrib for autocompletion.

*Parameters*:

   * =web=: the web the user can choose topics from; defaults to current web
   * =default=: the default value to use if no value exists yet
   * =url=: url for autocompletion, default: =%<nop>SCRIPTURL{"rest"}%/RenderPlugin/template?expand=select2::topic;contenttype=application/json=
   * =TopicType=: name of a !TopicType to be selected

Custom parameters may be added. These will be appended to the autocompletion url.

There are a couple of parameters that further customize the behavior of the select2 widget. Some of the most useful ones are:

   * =minimumInputLength=: number of characters that have to be entered before the autocompletion url is called to fetch matching selections from the backend; default 0
   * =quietMillis=: number of milliseconds to wait for input before the backend is called for autocompletion
   * =limit=: maximum number of values fetched from the autocompletion backend, default 10

These are also available for the =user= and =icon= formfield types.

---+++ =user=

A user reference using JQSelect2Contrib for autocompletion.

*Parameters*:

   * =url=: url for autocompletion, default: =%<nop>SCRIPTURL{"rest"}%/RenderPlugin/template?expand=select2::user;contenttype=application/json=
   * =form=: !DataForm supposed to be attached to user profile pages; this form is used to search for users, default: !UserForm
